Description: Graphical and statistical analyses of environmental data, with 
  focus on analyzing chemical concentrations and physical parameters, usually in 
  the context of mandated environmental monitoring.  Major environmental 
  statistical methods found in the literature and regulatory guidance documents, 
  with extensive help that explains what these methods do, how to use them, 
  and where to find them in the literature.  Numerous built-in data sets from 
  regulatory guidance documents and environmental statistics literature.  Includes 
  scripts reproducing analyses presented in the book "EnvStats:  An R Package for 
  Environmental Statistics" (Millard, 2013, Springer, ISBN 978-1-4614-8455-4, 
  <doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-8456-1>).
