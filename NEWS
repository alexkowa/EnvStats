Changes in Version 2.7.9 2022.03.07
 - switching results from S3 class htest to htestEnvStats to avoid conflict with the stricter check of the htest class in R >= 4.2

Changes in Version 2.6.0 2022.03.01
- use weights in the lm call in calibrate()
- fixing bootstrap two.sided ci argument test #13 (James Durant)

Changes in Version 2.4.0, 2019.01.14:
  o Justin Jent added option for two-sided confidence intervals in predIntNormSimultaneous() and predIntNormSimultaneousK()

Changes in Version 2.3.0, 2017.10.09:

	o Updated the function gofTestCensored() to peform a goodness-of-fit test
	  using censored data for any continuous distribution that has an associated
	  estimation method for censored data.

	o Added the function distChooseCensored() to automatically choose a distribution based on
	  a series of goodness-of-fit tests performed by calling the gofTestCensored() function.

	o Added the function distChoose() to automatically choose a distribution based on
	  a series of goodness-of-fit tests performed by calling the gofTest() function.

	o For the function egamma():
	  --Now allows computation of one-sided lower and one-sided upper
	    confidence intervals when ci.method="profile.likelihood".
	  --Added the option ci.method="chisq.adj", which uses the method of
	    Grice and Bain (1980) to compute a confidence interval for the mean.
	    This is equivalent to the "adjusted gamma" method of ProUCL.
	  --Added the data object Grice.Bain.80.mat, which is used by egamma() when
	    ci.method="chisq.adj".  (See the help file for Grice.Bain.80.mat.)
	  --Fixed the help file for the function egamma() so that it correctly states
	    that when method="bcmle" the scale parameter is computed based on the
	    bias-corrected mle of the shape parameter.

	o For the function gofTest():  added the options test="ad" (Anderson-Darling),
	  test="cvm" (Cramer-von Mises), test="lillie" (Lilliefors),
	  test="ProUCL.ad.gamma" and test="ProUCL.ks.gamma".
	  See the help file for gofTest() for more information.

	o Due to issues with numerical integration, rewrote the functions
	  evNormOrdStats() and evNormOrdStatsScalar().
	  The argument 'approximate' has been replaced with the argument 'method',
	  although the argument 'approximate' is still available to use for
	  for backwards compatibility.  See the help file for more details.
	  I am grateful to Gwern Branwen (www.gwern.net) for bringing
	  these issues to my attention.

	o Fixed a typographical error in Equation (4) of the help file for
	  evNormOrdStats() and evNormOrdStatsScalar().

	o Fixed minor bug in the function gofTest() that had resulted in an
	  incorrect names attribute for the "data" component of the returned list.

	o The following ggproto objects have been exported so that advanced users who are
	  curious may see them.
	  --StatNText:             Called by stat_n_text.
	  --StatMeanSDText:        Called by stat_mean_sd_text.
	  --StatMedianIQRText:     Called by stat_median_iqr_text.
	  --StatTestText:          Called by stat_test_text.


========================

Changes in Version 2.2.1, 2017.01.13:

	o Added the function geom_stripchart(), which is a geom that works under the package ggplot2
	  and is the analogue to the EnvStats function stripChart().  Also added the following
	  supporting functions for geom_stripchart():
	  --stat_n_text:           beneath each group, displays text indicating the sample size.
	  --stat_mean_sd_text:     above each group, displays text indicating the mean and standard deviation.
	  --stat_median_iqr_text:  above each group, displays text indicating the median and interquartile range.
	  --stat_test_text:        at top of panel, displays text indicating the test results comparing groups.

	o Updated the function eqnpar():
	  -- Added the argument "type" to allow the user to specify how the estimated
	     quantile is computed.  This argument is passed to the quantile() function.
	  -- Added the option ci.method="interpolate" (now the default).
	  -- Changed the behavior when ci.method="exact".
	  -- Changed the behavior when ci.method="normal.approx".

	o Fixed bug in the function gofTestCensored() for the case when there is only
	  one censoring level but the sample is still considered to be multiply censored
	  because the censoring level is
	  larger than the smallest uncensored observation (left-censored data) or
	  smaller than the largest uncensored observation (right-censored data).

	o Updated the help files for enormCensored(), elnormCensored(),
	  elnormAltCensored(), and gofTestCensored():
	  -- The default value for prob.method is prob.method="hirsch-stedinger",
	     not "michael-schucany".

========================

Changes in Version 2.1.1, 2016.06.13:

	o Updated the function stripChart():
	  -- For the case when there are two independent groups and
	     plot.diff=TRUE and paired=TRUE:
	     ++ Adjusted the default value of diff.lim.
	     ++ Added the argument diff.method to indicate what method to use to
	        plot the paired differences.  The default value is diff.method="stack".
	  -- For the case when there are two independent groups and
	     plot.diff=TRUE and paired=FALSE:
	     ++ The default value for the argument diff.lim (which determines the
	        range on the axis associated with the confidence interval for the
	        difference between groups) is now on the same scale as the range of
	        the original observations.
	     ++ The default location of the confidence interval for the difference
	        between groups has changed slightly.
	  -- Fixed a bug for the case when ci.and.test='parametric' and the argument
	     test.arg.list contains components named 'paired' and 'var.equal'.
	  -- When the argument test.arg.list is supplied with a component named
	     'paired' and the value of that component does not match the value of
	     the argument 'paired', the value of the component is set to the value of
	     the argument 'paired' and a warning is issued.
	  -- Fixed a bug for the case when add=TRUE.

	o Updated the function summaryStats():
	  -- Takes the new argument 'paired' applicable to the case when there are 2 groups
	     that are paired observations.
	     ++ When paired=TRUE and p.value=TRUE, the paired t-test
	        or paired Wilcoxon test is performed.
	  -- Fixed bug for the case when there are 2 independent groups, test="parametric",
	     and the argument 'test.arg.list' contains the component paired=TRUE.

	o Updated the functions enormCensored() and elnormCensored():
	  -- The argument 'method' now accepts the values "ROS" and "rROS"
	     (i.e., you can set method="ROS" or method="rROS").
	     ++ The ROS method denotes the Regression on Order Statistics method.
	        This method is equivalent to the already existing method
	        Quantile-Quantile Regression (method ="qq.reg").
	     ++ The rROS method denotes the robust Regression on Order Statistics method.
	        This method is equivalent to the already existing method
	        Imputation Using Quantile-Quantile Regression (method ="impute.w.qq.reg").

	o Updated the function elnormAltCensored():
	  -- The argument 'method' now accepts the value "rROS" (i.e., you can set
	     method="rROS"), denoting the robust Regression on Order Statistics method.
	     This method is equivalent to the already existing method
	     Imputation Using Quantile-Quantile Regression (method ="impute.w.qq.reg").

========================

Changes in Version 2.1.0, 2016.04.18:

	o Added the datasets ACE.13.TCE.df and Helsel.Hirsch.02.Mayfly.df.

	o Updated summaryStats():
	  -- Fixed bug so it does not return an error when the argument 'object' is a
	     logical or character vector.
	  -- Fixed bug so it uses the argument test.arg.list in the case when there
	     are 2 groups, test="parametric", and group.p.value.type="within".
	  -- When p.value=TRUE and there are 2 groups, added estimate of difference in
	     location to output:
	     when test="parametric" shows the difference between the means, and
	     when test="nonparametric" shows the median of the difference between
	     a sample from group 1 and a sample from group 2.

	o Updated stripChart():
	  -- Takes new argument 'plot.diff' applicable to the case when there are 2 groups.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE and paired=FALSE, the confidence interval
	        for the difference between the two locations is displayed and the right axis
	        (when vertical=TRUE) or top axis (when vertical=FALSE) is labeled in units of
	        the confidence interval for the difference between the two locations.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE and paired=TRUE, the paired differences are
	        displayed and the right axis (when vertical=TRUE) or
	        top axis (when vertical=FALSE) is labeled in units of the paired differences.
	        In addition, if show.ci=TRUE, the confidence interval based on the paired
	        differences is displayed.

	  -- Takes new argument 'paired' applicable to the case when there are
	     2 groups that are paired observations.
		++ When paired=TRUE and p.value=TRUE, the paired t-test
		   or paired Wilcoxon test is performed.

	  -- Takes new argument 'paired.lines'.
	     When paired=TRUE and paired.lines=TRUE, lines are drawn between the
	     paired observations.

	  -- Takes new argument 'paired.lty'.
	     When paired=TRUE and paired.lines=TRUE, paired.lty is a vector indicating
	     the line types to use to distinguish different paired observations.

	  -- Takes new argument 'paired.lwd'.
	     When paired=TRUE and paired.lines=TRUE, paired.lwd is a scalar or vector
             indicating the width of the lines used to distinguish different paired observations.

	  -- Takes new argument 'paired.pch'.
	     When paired=TRUE and paired.lines=TRUE, paired.pch is a vector indicating
	     the plotting symbols to use to distinguish different paired observations.

	  -- Takes new argument 'paired.col'.
	     When paired=TRUE and paired.lines=TRUE, paired.col is a vector indicating
	     the color of the lines and/or plotting symbols to use to distinguish
	     different paired observations.  This argument overrides the argument 'col'.

	  -- Takes new argument 'diff.col'.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE and paired=TRUE, diff.col indicates the color
	        of the displayed paired differences and the color of the confidence
	        interval when show.ci=TRUE.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE and paired=FALSE, diff.col indicates the color
	        of the confidence interval for the difference between the two means
	        when show.ci=TRUE.
	     ++ This argument overrides the argument 'col'.

	  -- Takes new argument 'diff.pch'.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE and paired=TRUE, diff.pch indicates the plotting
	        symbol for the displayed paired differences.
	     ++ This argument overrides the argument 'pch'.

	  -- Takes new arguments 'diff.name', 'diff.name.cex', and 'diff.axis.label'.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE, diff.name is a character string indicating the
	        the label for the difference between the two groups.  The default value
	        is Group 2 Name - Group 1 Name where Group 1 Name and Group 2 Name indicate
	        the name of the first and second groups, respectively.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE, diff.name.cex is a numeric scalar indicating
	        what value of cex to use to plot the character indicating the estimate of
	        of the difference between groups 1 and 2.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE, diff.axis.label is a character string indicating the
	        the label for the axis associated with the difference between the two groups.
	        The default value is "Difference Between Groups" when paired=FALSE, and
                "Paired Difference" when paired=TRUE.

	  -- Takes new arguments 'diff.lim' and 'diff.at'.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE, diff.lim is a numeric vector of length 2 indicating the
                limits to use for the axis associated with the difference between the two groups.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE, diff.at is a numeric vector indicating where to place
                tick marks on the axis associated with the difference between the two groups.

	  -- Takes new arguments 'sep.line', 'sep.lty', 'sep.lwd', and 'sep.col'.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE, sep.line is a logical scalar indicating whether to
	        draw a line between the second group and the difference between groups 1 and 2.
	        The default value is sep.line=TRUE.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE, sep.lty is a numeric scalar indicating the line type to
	        use to draw the line between the second group and difference between groups
	        1 and 2.  The default value is sep.lty=2.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE, sep.lwd is a numeric scalar indicating the width of the
	        line to draw between the second group and difference between groups
	        1 and 2.  The default value is sep.lwd=cex.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE, sep.col is a numeric scalar or character string indicating
	        the color of the line to draw between the second group and difference between
	        groups 1 and 2.  The default value is sep.col="gray".

	  -- Takes new arguments 'plot.diff.mar'.
	     ++ When plot.diff=TRUE and add = FALSE, plot.diff.mar is a numeric vector of
	        length 4 indicating the value of the mar graphics parameter to use for the plot.
	        The default value is c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 4.1), which differs from the usual
	        default value in that the value for side 4 is 4.1 instead of 2.1.  This allows
	        for room to add an axis and axis label on side 4 indicating that that axis
	        represents the difference between the 2 groups.

	o Updated help files and fixed formatting issues in the PDF version.

========================

Changes in Version 2.0.2, 2015.11.17:

	o Updated rosnerTest() and help file:
	  -- The minimum number of non-missing, finite values in the argument x
	     can now be 3 instead of 10.
	  -- An updated version of Rosner's (1983) Table 1 is given in the help file.
	     The table shows the observed Type I error levels for various combinations of
	     sample sizes and values of k.
	  -- The conditions for when a warning is issued when warn=TRUE have been
	     slightly altered.  See the help file for more information.

	o Fixed bugs in stripChart.default() so that
	  -- The title indicates the correct test when the argument
	     test.arg.list includes the component paired=TRUE.
	  -- Does not return an error when the first argument is not a
	     formula and there are missing values and p.value=TRUE.

	o Updated help files and fixed formatting issues in the PDF version.

========================

Changes in Version 2.0.1, 2015.05.24:

	o Updated stripChart() by adding the arguments
	  ci.bar.lwd and nsmall.
	  See the help file for details.

	o Fixed bug in summaryStats.formula() so that it will correctly
	  deal with a character or logical vector as its first argument.

	o Fixed bug in errorBar() so that it does not pass high-level
	  graphics arguments to segments().

	o Updated help files and fixed formatting issues in the PDF version.

========================

Changes in Version 2.0.0, 2015.03.09:

	o EnvStats contains a modified version of the R function predict.lm().
	  To comply with CRAN policy, added the generic function predict() and the
	  function predict.default(), and also updated the already existing (within
	  EnvStats) predict.lm() function.

	o EnvStats contains a modified version of the R function print.htest().
	  To comply with CRAN policy, added the generic function print() and the
	  function print.default().

	o Included the function errorBar() in the NAMESPACE.  This function allows
	  the user to plot error bars.  See the help file for more information.

	o Updated the function calibrate() to return an object of class "calibrate"
	  which inherits from class "lm".

	o Included the function print.gofOutlier() in the NAMESPACE so that the results
	  print correctly for the function rosnerTest() to perform Rosner's test for
	  outliers assuming a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

	o Updated summaryStats() so that it will accept a character or logical vector
	  as its first argument.

	o Updated stripChart() so that it will accept a numeric matrix as its
	  first argument.

	o Fixed a bug in the function elnorm3() for the case when method="lmle".
	  (Thanks to Jon Hosking for pointing this out!).

	o Fixed formatting problems in the PDF version of the help files.

========================

Changes in Version 1.0.3, 2014.10.20:

	o Added the function rosnerTest to perform Rosner's test for outliers in a
	  normal (Gaussian) distribution.

	o Modified the function stripChart():
		- The argument ci.offset is now allowed to be either a scalar or
		  a vector of length equal to the number of groups.
		- A new argument group.names.cex has been added to give explicit
		  control over the size of the group labels.

	o Fixed a bug in gofTestCensored() for the case when the data contain only
	  one censored observation and the censored observation is larger than
	  the smallest non-censored observation for left-censored data or is smaller than
	  the largest non-censored observation for right-censored data.

	o Fixed a bug in anovaPE() that allowed the user to attempt to compute a
	  lack-of-fit and pure error anova table when there are not enough degrees of
	  freedom to do so.

	o Fixed a bug in calibrate() to allow only models with enough degrees of
	  freedom to be tested for lack-of-fit via anovaPE.  Also added the arguments
	  test.higher.orders and F.test.

	o Modified detectionLimitCalibrate() as follows:

	  + now returns not just the detection limit but both the decision limit
	    (on the scale of the signal) and the detection limit (on the scale of
	    the concentration).

	  + changed the default value for the argument simultaneous to simultaneous=TRUE.

	o Fixed a bug in signTest: values equal to the the argument mu were not
          being discarded.  (Thanks to Ed Gilroy for pointing this out!).

	o Fixed a bug in enparCensored: error message appeared when
	  ci.method="bootstrap".  (Thanks to Dennis Helsel for pointing this
	  out!).

	o Fixed a bug in enormCensored when method="mle", ci=TRUE,
	  ci.method="normal.approx", and ci.type="lower" or ci.type="upper":
	  LCL and UCL were switched.  (Thanks to Dennis Helsel for pointing
	  this out!).

	o For enormCensored, elnormCensored, elnormAltCensored, egammaCensored,
	  egammaAltCensored, and epoisCensored, one-sided confidence intervals are
	  now available when ci.method="profile.likelihood".

	o For enparCensored, enormCensored, elnormCensored, elnormAltCensored,
	  egammaCensored, egammaAltCensored, and epoisCensored, arguments and results
	  returned when ci.method="bootstrap" have been updated:

	  + The argument use.acc.con has been deprecated.  Bias-corrected
	    and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap results are now always computed
	    where the acceleration constant is estimated rather than allowing
	    the user to set it to 0 (i.e., setting use.acc.con=FALSE in
	    older versions of EnvStats).  Note that 1) code that explicitly
	    set use.acc.con=FALSE will no longer work for these functions, and
	    2) use.acc.con=FALSE was the default so results run previously
	    will not match what is now returned (even if the random seed is
	    set to the same value as was used before).

	  + The argument ci.type is now allowed to be "lower" or "upper".

	  + As before, there are two sets of confidence limits that are returned:

	      * percentile confidence limits (denoted Pct.LCL and Pct.UCL) and

	      * bias-corrected and accelerated confidence limits (denoted
	        BCa.LCL and BCa.UCL)

	  + For enparCensored, a third set of confidence limits are also returned:

	      * studentized confidence limits (denoted t.LCL and t.UCL)


	o Fixed bugs in oneSamplePermutationTest and twoSamplePermutationTestLocation:
	  the default value of the argument seed is now set to seed=NULL.

	o Fixed a bug in kendallSeasonalTrendTest: an error message appeared when
	  the argument 'y' was supplied as a matrix and independent.obs=FALSE.

	o Change all calls to the EnvStats global variable Distribution.df to
	  EnvStats::Distribution.df.

	o Fixed formatting problems in the PDF version of the help files.

========================

Changes in Version 1.0.2, 2013.10.29:

	o Changed the names of functions used for minimization in the following functions:

	  ciBinomN.vec, elnorm3, enormMultiplyCensored.mle, enormSinglyCensored.mle,
	  predIntPois

========================

Changes in Version 1.0.1:

	o Fixed bugs in the following functions that had misspelled variable
	  names or variables that had not been defined:

	  ci.gamma.chisq.approx, ci.lnorm3.zero.skew, ciBinomN, eqlnorm,
	  plot.gofCensored, ppccNormMultiplyCensoredGofTest,
	  ppccNormSinglyCensoredGofTest, predIntPois, print.boxcox,
	  print.boxcoxCensored

========================

Changes in Version 1.0.0

	o The current version of EnvStats is Version 1.0.0.

	o EnvStats is built upon Version 2.0 of the S-PLUS module "EnvironmentalStats for S-PLUS".  It includes numerous additions and changes.

	o Function and data object names in EnvStats differ from those in EnvironmentalStats for S-PLUS.  All objects that begin with an upper case letter are data objects, and all functions begin with a lower case letter.  So for example, all data objects that began with "epa." in EnvironmentalStats for S-PLUS begin with "EPA." in EnvStats.

	o For former EnvironmentalStats for S-PLUS users, here are the name conversions for the functions:
